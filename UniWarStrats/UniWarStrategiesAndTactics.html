      <h2>Five rules for efficient teamplay</h2>

        <p>Playing in team in UniWar follows similar rules as playing solo but there are a few extra rules you should adhere when playing in a team. Following these rules you should be able to let your team grow together and ultimately win a lot of teamgames. These rules apply to tournament games just as to ranked or custom games.</p>
        <p>The first Rule: The team's win is your agenda. Thou shalt not have a personal agenda beside it.</p>
        <p>The second Rule: Never let an oppurtunity slip to help your teammate to reach a <a href="#Library">goal</a> and gain an important advantage.</p>
        <p>The third Rule: Be ready to get sacrificed.</p>
        <p>The fourth Rule: Communicate as much as needed and as little as possible.</p>
        <p>The fifth Rule: We all have a RL.</p>

      <h2>The path to victory is beset on all sides by minor goals achieved</h2> 
      <div class="image-container-right">

        <p>UniWar plays a little bit like chess. In Chess your ultimate goal is to defeat your enemy by checkmating the enemy king. You reach that goal by achieving minor goals like favorable trades, hindering enemy pieces from advancing or creating vicious situations like fork attacks. The same applies to UniWar. To reach your ultimate goal of winning the match you have to pursue minor goals that help you reach your ultimate goal by shifting advantage in your favor. But what are these goals and which ones are most important to achieve? This will be covered in the full article. </p>

      <h2>The fake cap</h2>
      <div class="image-container-left">

      </div>
      <div class="article-content"></div>
        <p>This is more a stratagem than a strategy, since your're trying to trick your enemy and it's highly situational. The idea is to make it look like you're making a cap without actually making one by placing a unit on a neutral/enemy base in order to achieve a higher ranking <a href="#Library">goal</a> on your next turn such as capping an enemy base or at least preventing the enemy of capping an important base. For this to work you need your opponent to not pay 100% attention, so I wouldn't recommend this for tournament games. If this beautiful deception succeds, your enemy will be flabbergasted that you have more units on the board than he anticipated. For a more detailed description of when and how to pull this off, see the full article.</p>
